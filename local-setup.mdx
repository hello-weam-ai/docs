## Get your **Weam AI** application running locally with Docker and start building.

---
## Mac/Linux Setup 

### Step 1: Set up your environment

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="copy" title="Clone the repository">
To begin, clone the project from GitHub and create your environment file.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/weam-ai/weamai.git
cd weamai
cp .env.example .env
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Build and run with Docker (Mac/Linux)">
Use the following commands to build and run the project using Docker Compose:

```bash
bash build.sh
docker compose up --build
```

This will:
- Build all necessary Docker images
- Start backend, frontend, and supporting services

<Note>Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed before proceeding.</Note>
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>


### Step 2: Access the application

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="globe" title="Visit the web interface">
Once the containers are running, access the application in your browser:

- [Signup Page](http://localhost:3000/register)  
- [Login Page](http://localhost:3000/login)
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>


### Step 3: System requirements

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="terminal" title="Minimum configuration">
To ensure smooth execution, your system must meet these minimum requirements:

> üß† **RAM:** 2 GB  
> üñ•Ô∏è **CPU:** Dual-core (2 cores)

<Tip>If you're experiencing performance issues, consider closing background apps or upgrading resources.</Tip>
</Accordion>

## Docker + WSL2 Setup on Windows

Follow this guide to install Docker, set up WSL2 with Ubuntu, and run your development environment smoothly from within Windows.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="download" title="1. Install Docker Desktop for Windows">
**Download Docker Desktop:**  
üëâ [Install Guide](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/)

During installation:
- ‚úÖ Enable **WSL 2 integration**
- ‚úÖ Choose your preferred Linux distro (e.g., **Ubuntu**)
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="terminal" title="2. Install WSL2 with Ubuntu">
Run in **PowerShell (Admin)**:

```powershell
wsl --install Ubuntu
```

This will:
- Enable WSL features
- Install Ubuntu
- Set as default

**Restart your PC** after installation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="window" title="3. Open Ubuntu (WSL2 Terminal)">
Click **Start ‚Üí Ubuntu**, then set your **username and password** on first launch.
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="code" title="4. Set VS Code to Use LF Line Endings">
> ‚ö†Ô∏è `.sh` files with `CRLF` may break in WSL/Linux.

1. Open folder in **VS Code**
2. Bottom right: click `CRLF` ‚Üí change to `LF`
3. Save the file again
4. Repeat for all `.sh` files (e.g., `winbuild.sh`, `build.sh`)
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="docker" title="5. Ensure Docker Desktop is Running">
Launch **Docker Desktop** and wait for "Docker is running" message.
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="folder-open" title="6. Navigate to Project from Ubuntu">
In **Ubuntu terminal**, go to your project directory:

```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/path/to/your/project
```

> Example: `/mnt/c/Users/dhruvish/Documents/weam-ai-project`
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="play" title="7. Run winbuild.sh">
(Optional) Make script executable:

```bash
chmod +x winbuild.sh
```

Run it:

```bash
bash winbuild.sh
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="gear" title="8. Set Environment Variables">
Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your settings.
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="rocket" title="9. Run Docker Compose">
Start environment:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## ‚úÖ Key Reminders

- Always save `.sh` files with `LF` line endings
- Use **Ubuntu (WSL2)** terminal
- Ensure **Docker Desktop is running** before using Compose

# Skipped Step: Python Base Image Build (`pybase_docker`)

This section outlines why the `pybase_docker` build step is **intentionally skipped** in the Docker workflow and when to re-enable it.


## Overview

In the main build script, the following section is **commented out**:

```bash
# echo "Step 1/5: Building base image (pybase_docker)..."
# $COMPOSE_CMD build pybase_docker --no-cache || { echo "‚ùå Failed to build pybase_docker"; exit 1; }
# echo "‚úÖ pybase_docker image built successfully."
```

These lines are **intentionally skipped** to **improve build efficiency** and avoid unnecessary steps when working on the frontend or making non-Python-related changes.

## Why Is It Skipped?

| Reason                       | Description                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Not Required for Frontend | The `pybase_docker` image is **only used by backend services**. Frontend apps like `weamai-app` (Next.js) don't rely on it. |
| Time Efficiency           | Building Python images, especially with heavy dependencies, is **time-consuming**. Skipping it avoids delays.               |
| No Dependency Overlap     | Frontend builds and backend builds are **fully isolated**. Skipping the Python base does **not** affect frontend builds.    |


## When to Re-enable This Step

You **should uncomment and run** the `pybase_docker` build lines **if any of the following conditions apply**:

| Condition                     | Description                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `requirements.txt` Updated | If you modified dependencies, Docker needs to rebuild with the new packages.                                          |
| Clean Rebuild Required     | If you're doing a **fresh or forceful rebuild** (e.g., after removing Docker volumes/images), this step is essential. |
| Python Dependency Issues   | If backend services fail due to missing or outdated Python packages, a rebuild might resolve the issue.               |

To enable this step, simply **uncomment** the following lines in the script:

```bash
echo "Step 1/5: Building base image (pybase_docker)..."
$COMPOSE_CMD build pybase_docker --no-cache || { echo "‚ùå Failed to build pybase_docker"; exit 1; }
echo "‚úÖ pybase_docker image built successfully."
```
