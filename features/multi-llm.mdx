## Credit System

### Credit Usage Overview
- **Current Usage**: Monitor your credit consumption (e.g., 260.00 / 2000 credits)
- **Per-Message Costs**: Different models require different credit amounts
- **Usage Tracking**: Visual progress bar shows remaining credits
- **Budget Management**: Plan model usage based on available credits

## How to Switch Models

### Model Selection Process
1. **Locate Model Selector**: Click the model dropdown (e.g., "GPT 4.1") in the top interface

  <img
    src="/images/features/multi-llm/models.jpg"
    width="800"
    style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
  />

2. **View Available Options**: Browse all accessible models with their capabilities

  <img
    src="/images/features/multi-llm/all-models.jpg"
    width="800"
    style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
  />

3. **Check Credit Costs**: Review credit requirements for each model
4. **Select Model**: Click on your preferred model for the current task
5. **Continue Chatting**: Start or continue conversations with the new model

### Model Capabilities Comparison

Each model displays:
- **Model Name**: Clear identification of the AI model
- **Description**: Brief explanation of model strengths and use cases
- **Credit Cost**: Exact credit requirement per message
- **Capability Icons**: Visual indicators for supported features (document analysis, vision, code generation, etc.)

## Best Practices

### Credit Management
- **Monitor Usage**: Keep track of remaining credits in the progress bar
- **Plan Ahead**: Consider credit costs when selecting models for long conversations
- **Optimize Spending**: Use appropriate model complexity for each task
- **Budget Allocation**: Distribute credits across different model types based on needs

### Workflow Integration
- **Context Continuity**: Switch models mid-conversation while maintaining context
- **Capability Matching**: Use different models for different parts of complex projects
- **Quality Comparison**: Test multiple models on similar tasks to find preferences
- **Team Coordination**: Establish model selection guidelines for consistent team usage

Remember that model availability and credit costs may vary based on your subscription plan and current platform offerings.
