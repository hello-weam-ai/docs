## What Can You Do With Weam AI?

The platform combines conversational interfaces, document processing, and knowledge management in a single workspace:

**Access Multiple Models:** Switch between GPT-5, Claude, Gemini, and other models within the same conversation. Choose the best model for each task without managing separate subscriptions or APIs.

**Build Custom Agents:** Create specialized assistants for specific business functions. Upload domain knowledge, define workflows, and deploy agents that understand your organization's context.

**Collaborate on Workflows:** Share prompts, agents, and conversations across your team. Organize work in Brains (workspaces) with proper access controls and collaboration features.

**Integrate External Services:** Connect Slack, GitHub, Google Workspace, and other tools through MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration. Let your agents access and work with your existing data sources.

**Host on Your Infrastructure:** Deploy Weam AI on your own servers or cloud infrastructure. Maintain complete control over data processing, storage, and access policies.
