title: "Sales video call analyzer agent"
---

Sales teams and account managers often struggle to remember key details from numerous client calls. Questions like "What was the agreed cost?", "When should I follow up?", and "Did I miss any important points?" plague post-call analysis. Manually reviewing call recordings is time-consuming and inefficient. The Client Video Call Analyzer Agent automates this process, helping teams extract actionable insights and improve their sales performance.

## What It Does

- Upload client videos (e.g., Loom or screen recordings)
- Automatically generate summaries, action items, and key highlights
- Use a default prompt or customize it for your needs
- Optionally input **YouTube URLs** for public video analysis
- Adjust logic and behavior in the backend as required

## How It Works

1. **Input** – Upload a Loom file or paste a YouTube link  
2. **Prompt Application** – A structured summarization prompt analyzes the content  
3. **AI Model** – Uses **Gemini 2.0 Flash API** for fast, context-aware responses  
4. **Output** – Delivers a concise summary with themes, requests, and follow-ups  

### Why Gemini 2.0 Flash?

- **Fast inference speeds** for lengthy transcripts  
- **High summarization accuracy** on conversational language  
- **Multimodal readiness** for future video + audio support  
- **Cost efficiency** for frequent or large-scale use  

## Built for Sales Teams – Adaptable for Any Client-Facing Role

Although designed for sales teams, this agent can be tailored for:
1. **Customer Success** – Analyze support calls and satisfaction
2. **Account Management** – Track client relationships and needs
3. **Consulting** – Document client requirements and feedback
4. **Training Teams** – Create coaching materials from real calls
  

## Example Output

```txt
Client requests a streamlined onboarding flow with fewer screens.  
Pain-point: current form length.  
Action Item: deliver revised wireframe by next Thursday.  
```

## Functional Overview

| Capability                               | Description                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Video Upload & Context Extraction** | Uploads video, generates summarized context via Gemini Cache API   |
| **LLM-Powered Analysis**              | Performs deep communication analysis using prompts and transcripts |
| **Insight Generation**                | Summarizes tone, engagement, pauses, objections, and talk dynamics |
| **Response Storage**                  | Saves final insights to backend or chat UI                         |


## Directional Execution Flow

```plaintext
VIDEO ANALYSIS PIPELINE

1.  Upload video file to Gemini Files API
    → Validate file size and duration (Gemini constraints)
    ↓

2.  Initialize LLM
    → Load OpenAI or Gemini LLM for downstream analysis
    ↓

3.  Initialize History & Memory
    → Store user session, video metadata, and prior results
    ↓

4.  Create Context via Gemini Cache API
    → Pre-process video to extract semantic context
    ↓

5.  Add Prompt Templates
    → Insert pre-defined instructions:
       - Objection handling
       - Sentiment detection
       - Engagement cues
       - Talk ratio & pauses
    ↓

6.  Call LLM with Cached Video Context + Prompts
    → Generate deep meeting insights
    ↓

7.  Track Token Usage
    → Calculate total tokens + estimated cost
    ↓

8.  Store Final Response
    → Save result (⚠️ not persisted inside `additional_kwargs`)
```
