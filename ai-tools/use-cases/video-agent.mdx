## Client Sales Call Analyzer Agent

Project managers, product teams, and client-facing roles often receive long video recordings from customers—explaining requirements, giving feedback, or outlining goals. Reviewing these videos manually can be slow, repetitive, and error-prone.

The **Client Sales Call Analyzer Agent** automates that process, helping teams extract actionable insights quickly and consistently.

## What It Does

- Upload client videos (e.g., Loom or screen recordings)
- Automatically generate summaries, action items, and key highlights
- Use a default prompt or customize it for your needs
- Optionally input **YouTube URLs** for public video analysis
- Adjust logic and behavior in the backend as required

---

## How It Works

1. **Input** – Upload a Loom file or paste a YouTube link  
2. **Prompt Application** – A structured summarization prompt analyzes the content  
3. **AI Model** – Uses **Gemini 2.0 Flash API** for fast, context-aware responses  
4. **Output** – Delivers a concise summary with themes, requests, and follow-ups  

### Why Gemini 2.0 Flash?

- **Fast inference speeds** for lengthy transcripts  
- **High summarization accuracy** on conversational language  
- **Multimodal readiness** for future video + audio support  
- **Cost efficiency** for frequent or large-scale use
