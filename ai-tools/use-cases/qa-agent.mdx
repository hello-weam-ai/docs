AI Execution Steps:

1.  Initialize LLM
2.  Initialize Checklist & PageSpeed Queues
3.  Scrape the URL â†’ Extract all code files (PHP, HTML, JS, CSS)
4.  Clean & Filter Unnecessary Code Lines
5.  Call PageSpeed API:
      â”œâ”€ Mobile Analysis
      â””â”€ Desktop Analysis
6.  Count Tokens in Scraped Content
7.  Initialize LLM Memory & History
8.  Create LLM Chains:
      â”œâ”€ Scraped Content Analysis Chain
      â””â”€ PageSpeed Checklist Analysis Chain
9.  Batch Checklist Items (10 per call)
10. Batch PageSpeed Results
11. Add Prompt Templates
12. Call LLM for Checklist Analysis (batch-wise)
      â†’ Stream JSON Results into Checklist Queue
13. On Checklist Completion:
      â†’ Start PageSpeed Analysis
      â†’ Stream JSON Results into PageSpeed Queue
14. Parse PageSpeed JSON (Mobile & Desktop)
      â†’ Format into UI-ready table structure
15. Combine All Results
      â†’ Generate Final Excel Report
16. Upload Excel Report to AWS S3
17. Return Final API Response:
      â”œâ”€ PageSpeed JSON  
      â”œâ”€ Excel S3 Filename  
      â””â”€ Token Usage & Cost Breakdown
18. Persist Results (Include in `additional_kwargs`)
```
