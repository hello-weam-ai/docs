## Detailed OAuth Setup Instructions

Steps to set up OAuth with GitHub to get your Client ID, Client Secret, and configure redirect URLs:

### Create a GitHub OAuth App

#### Navigate to GitHub Settings
- Go to GitHub and sign in to your account
- Click your profile picture in the top-right corner
- Select "Settings" from the dropdown menu

#### Access Developer Settings
- Scroll down in the left sidebar and click "Developer settings"
- Click "OAuth Apps" in the left sidebar

### Create New OAuth App
- Click the "New OAuth App" button
- You'll see a form to register your application

### Fill Out Application Details
- **Application name**: Enter a descriptive name for your app  
- **Homepage URL**: Enter your application's homepage URL (e.g., https://yourapp.com)  
- **Application description**: (Optional) Add a brief description  
- **Authorization callback URL**: This is your redirect URL where GitHub will send users after authorization (e.g., https://yourapp.com/auth/github/callback)  

### Register the Application
- Click "Register application" to create your OAuth app

### Retrieve Your Credentials
#### Get Client ID and Client Secret
- After registration, you'll be redirected to your app's settings page
- Your Client ID will be displayed prominently
- Click "Generate a new client secret" to create your Client Secret
- Copy and securely store both values immediately (the client secret won't be shown again)

### Managing Redirect URLs
#### Update Redirect URLs (if needed)
- From your OAuth app settings page, you can modify the "Authorization callback URL"
- For development, you might use `http://localhost:3000/auth/github/callback`
- For production, use your actual domain
- Click "Update application" to save changes

### Important Security Notes
- Keep your Client Secret private and never expose it in client-side code  
- Use environment variables to store these credentials in your application  
- The redirect URL must exactly match what you configure in GitHub (including protocol, domain, port, and path)  
- You can update these settings anytime from the OAuth Apps section in your GitHub developer settings  
- Your OAuth flow will then redirect users to GitHub for authorization and back to your specified callback URL with an authorization code that you can exchange for an access token.
