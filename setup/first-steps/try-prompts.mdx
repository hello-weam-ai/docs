Prompts in Weam AI are reusable conversation starters that help users interact more efficiently with AI models. 

By saving frequently used prompts, users can quickly access their standard queries, eliminating the need to retype common requests.

## Saving Queries as Prompts

You can directly save frequently asked queries as Prompts by clicking on the 'save as Prompt' functionality. 

Weam AI's prompt templates go beyond basic text inputs by providing a detailed structure. These templates are designed to capture information about your brand, company, or product, making every AI interaction more relevant.

Team members can access Prompts across the platform. That means all team members can use Prompts created by other members even if they are not part of that particular brain.

## Prompt Template Fields

### Brand Profile Fields
The Brand Profile template captures essential brand elements including name, slogan, mission, values, and target audience information. 

By incorporating these key brand identifiers, AI responses automatically align with your brand's tone and messaging, making content creation more consistent.

### Company Info Fields
With fields for company name, mission, values, overview, vision, and location details, this template ensures AI understands your company's complete context. 

These details help generate responses that accurately reflect your company's positioning and corporate identity in every interaction.

### Product Info Fields
This template includes crucial product details like name, category, description, USPs, specifications, and benefits. 

Having these product-specific fields helps AI generate precise, feature-focused content, making it useful for product-related communications and marketing materials.
