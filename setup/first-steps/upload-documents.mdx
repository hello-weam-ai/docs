title: "Upload Documents"
---

Documents in Weam AI serve as a centralized space where teams can store and access various types of files. 

When you upload documents during a chat, whether they're PDFs or Word files, they're automatically stored in the "Docs" section of your Brain.

The AI functionality in Weam AI can read and understand these documents, making their content available for reference during conversations. 

**For example**: If you upload a product manual, you can later ask questions about its contents, and the AI will provide accurate answers based on that document.

## Supported Files and Capacity

- Upload up to **10 documents simultaneously** in a single upload session during a chat
- Each individual file can be up to **5MB in size**
- All uploaded documents are securely stored within your Brain and remain **accessible to all team members** who are part of that Brain

This makes document sharing perfect for company policies, training materials, project documentation, or any other important files your team needs to reference.

## How to Upload Documents

### Method 1: Direct Upload to Docs Section

1. **Navigate to Docs**: Go to the Docs section of your chosen Brain
2. **Click "Add a New Doc"**: Use the button in the top-right corner
3. **Select Files**: Choose files from your computer (up to 10 files, 5MB each)
4. **Upload**: Files will be processed and made available to all Brain members

### Method 2: Upload During Chat

1. **Start a Chat**: Begin a conversation in any Brain
2. **Use File Upload Icons**: Click the file attachment icon in the chat interface
3. **Select Documents**: Choose your files (same limits apply)
4. **Send**: Documents are automatically saved to the Brain's Docs section

## Document Management

Once uploaded, documents appear in the Docs section with:
- **Name**: Original filename or custom name
- **Owner**: Who uploaded the document
- **Upload Date**: When the document was added
- **File Type**: Visual indicator (PDF, DOC, etc.)

## Using Documents with AI

After uploading, you can:
- Reference documents in chat conversations

- Extract specific information or summaries

The AI can understand and work with the content of your uploaded documents, making them an integral part of your collaborative workspace.
