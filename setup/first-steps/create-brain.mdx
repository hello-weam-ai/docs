title: "Create a Brain"
---

Brains are organized spaces within Weam AI that store and manage all your AI interactions and resources. 

By separating information into dedicated Brains, organizations can maintain clear boundaries between different projects, teams, or initiatives while enabling smooth collaboration.

## Shared Brains

Shared Brains are collaborative knowledge centers where team members can collectively access and interact with AI models. Team members who are part of any particular Shared Brain can view and use every element within it including chat conversations, uploaded documents, saved prompts, and custom AI agents.

This visibility ensures that knowledge flows freely across your organization, enabling teams to learn from each other's experiences. Shared Brains are particularly valuable for team projects and cross-departmental initiatives, as they create a single source for all project-related AI interactions.

Every user automatically receives a Shared Brain named 'General Brain' upon signing up.

## Private Brains

Private Brains provide individual team members with their own personal AI workspace within Weam AI. Every user automatically receives a Private Brain named 'Default' upon signing up, creating a space for individual work and experimentation.

Private Brains are particularly useful for preliminary work. Users can test new ideas, refine prompts, and perfect their AI interactions before sharing them with the broader team. Users maintain complete control over their Private Brain. However, Admins can limit the usage of Private Brains for team members if needed.

## How to Create a Brain

### Step 1: Access Brain Creation
From the sidebar, click the "+" icon next to either "SHARED BRAINS" or "PRIVATE BRAINS" depending on what type of Brain you want to create.

### Step 2: Choose Brain Type
Select between:
- **Shared**: For team collaboration and project work
- **Personal**: For individual work and experimentation

### Step 3: Enter Brain Details
- **Brain Name**: Provide a descriptive name that clearly identifies the purpose or project
- **Add Members to Collaborate** (Shared Brains only): Search and select team members
- **Add Teams to Collaborate** (Shared Brains only): Select entire teams if available

### Step 4: Create Brain
Click "Add Brain" to complete the setup. Your new Brain will appear in the sidebar and be ready for use immediately.

## Best Practices

- Use clear, descriptive names for your Brains
