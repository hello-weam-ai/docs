<Info>
This guide covers service startup, health checks, connectivity testing, and verification steps for both local development and production deployments.
</Info>

## Start Services

Launch your Weam AI application services using Docker Compose.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Local Development">

**Navigate to project directory and start services:**

```bash
cd weam

# Start all services in detached mode
docker compose up -d

# Check service status
docker compose ps
```

**Expected container status:**
All services should show "Up" status for successful startup.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Production Deployment">

**Start services and verify web server:**

```bash
# Start services in background
docker compose up -d

# Verify NGINX is running
sudo systemctl status nginx

# Check SSL certificate status
curl -I https://your-domain.com
```

**Production checklist:**
- All Docker containers running
- NGINX service active
- SSL certificate valid
- Domain accessible via HTTPS

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Service Health Verification

Verify each Weam AI service is running correctly and responding to requests.

### Container Status Check

Monitor Docker container health and resource usage:

```bash
# Check all containers are running
docker compose ps

# Monitor resource usage
docker stats

# View service logs
docker compose logs frontend
docker compose logs backend
```

### Service Port Configuration

Verify services are listening on correct ports:

| Service | Port | Status Check |
|---------|------|--------------|
| **Frontend (Next.js)** | 3000 | `netstat -tlnp \| grep 3000` |
| **Backend (Node.js)** | 4050 | `netstat -tlnp \| grep 4050` |
| **MongoDB** | 27017 | Internal container network |
| **Redis** | 6379 | Internal container network |
| **Qdrant Vector DB** | 6333 | `curl http://localhost:6333` |

## Connectivity Testing

Test API endpoints and service communication to ensure proper functionality.

### Local Development Testing

Test each service endpoint for local development environment:

```bash
# Test frontend application
curl http://localhost:3000

# Test backend API health
curl http://localhost:4050/napi/health

# Test vector database
curl http://localhost:6333/health
```

**Expected responses:**
- Frontend: HTML page or redirect response
- Backend API: JSON health status
- Vector DB: Qdrant status information

### Production Deployment Testing

Test production deployment through NGINX proxy:

```bash
# Test HTTPS access
curl -I https://your-domain.com

# Test API endpoints through NGINX
curl https://your-domain.com/napi/health

# Verify SSL certificate
openssl s_client -connect your-domain.com:443 -servername your-domain.com
```

**SSL verification checklist:**
- Certificate valid and not expired
- Domain name matches certificate
- Certificate chain complete
- HTTPS redirect working

### Vector Database Test

Test Qdrant vector database for AI functionality:

```bash
# Check Qdrant collections
curl http://localhost:6333/collections

# Verify Qdrant health
curl http://localhost:6333/health
```
