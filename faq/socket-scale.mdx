## **Problem Statement: Why We Need Socket Scaling**

* **Single server limitation**: A single Node.js + Socket.IO instance can typically handle \~10Kâ€“30K concurrent connections before eventâ€‘loop delays, memory pressure, and OS fileâ€‘descriptor limits cause performance degradation.
* **Cross-server communication gap**: Without synchronization, events emitted on one instance (e.g. user in room on Server A) won't reach clients connected to another instance (Server B), creating message silos.
* **Resilience & high availability**: Heavy load demands horizontal scaling and resilience, including failâ€‘over across multiple node instances.



## **Solution: Horizontal Scaling Using Socket.IO + Redis Pub/Sub Adapter**

### 1. Deploy multiple Socket.IO server instances (Node.js cluster or separate nodes)

Use either:

* Node.js native `cluster` module to run workers per CPU core
* Multiple separate Socket.IO processes behind a load balancer (with sticky sessions)

### 2. Configure Redis adapter for cross-instance messaging

Use `@socket.io/redis-adapter` (version 7+ compatible with Socket.IO 4.x). It binds two Redis clients (pub and sub) and sets up Pub/Sub channels so that broadcasts or room emissions propagate across nodes.

### 3. Redis Pub/Sub flow:

* When Server A emits `io.to('room1').emit(...)`:

  * It broadcasts locally to connected clients in room1
  * It **publishes** the same event via Redis channel
* Other servers subscribed on that channel receive the message and emit it to their local clients in room1
* No persistent data is stored in Redisâ€”only ephemeral Pub/Sub messages

### 4. (Optional) Sharded adapter for Redis cluster scale

With Redis 7.0+, use `createShardedAdapter()` to distribute channels across shardsâ€”useful in large-scale setups with many rooms, including private/direct messages.

### 5. (Optional) External emitter

Use `@socket.io/redis-emitter` from a separate process (outside Socket.IO servers) to publish events directly to Redis, enabling loosely coupled services to push to clients.


## **Diagram of the Flow**

```
Client A               Client B
   â”‚                      â”‚
  Server A             Server B
     â”œâ”€â”€ local emit â”€â”€â–¶  â”‚
     â”‚                   â”‚
     â”‚  publish to Redis Pub/Sub channel
     â””â”€â”€â–¶ Redis â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–¶â”¬â”€ deliver to Server B
                         â””â”€ deliver back to Server A
     â””â”€â”€ Server B broadcasts to its local clients
```

This architecture ensures that regardless of which server a client connects to, they will receive real-time events from any other client or service in the system.
