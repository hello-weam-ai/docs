OpenRouter is a revolutionary platform that provides unified access to hundreds of AI models through a single API. Instead of managing multiple API keys and accounts for different AI providers, OpenRouter gives you one interface to access models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and many more.

## What is OpenRouter?

OpenRouter functions as an intermediary service that normalizes access to various AI models through a consistent API schema similar to OpenAI's Chat API. This allows developers to switch between different LLM providers without changing their code implementation.

OpenRouter serves as a unified API platform that connects users to a diverse array of models from providers such as:

- Anthropic  
- OpenAI  
- Google  
- Meta  
- Mistral AI  
- Others

**A - Spend**  
This metric shows your total financial expenditure on AI model usage over the selected time period. OpenRouter calculates the corresponding cost and deducts it from your credits based on your API usage.

**B - Tokens**  
This displays the total number of tokens processed, including both input tokens (your prompts) and output tokens (model responses). The activity page shows input and output tokens for comprehensive usage tracking.

**C - Requests**  
This shows the total number of API calls made to OpenRouter's models during the specified timeframe, giving you insight into your application's request frequency.

### Additional Features

- **Date Range Filter:** The "From" and "To" date selectors (24-06-2025 to 24-07-2025 in your screenshot) allow you to analyze usage patterns over specific periods.

- **Detailed Activity Table:** Below the summary cards, you'll find a comprehensive table with columns for::
  - Timestamp : Exact time of each API call
  - Provider/Model : Which AI model was used for the request
  - Application Name : The application or source making the request
  - Token count : Token count for that specific request
  - Cost per call : Individual request cost
  - Response speed : Response time metrics
  - Completion status : Completion status of the request

- **Export and Filter Tools:** The dashboard includes filtering capabilities and export functionality for detailed analysis and reporting.

## Why This Matters

This activity dashboard helps you see how you've been using models on OpenRouter by providing comprehensive usage analytics. OpenRouter's built-in Usage Accounting allows you to track AI model usage without making additional API calls, making it easy to monitor costs, optimize usage patterns, and understand your application's AI consumption patterns.
The dashboard is essential for budget management, performance optimization, and understanding which models and usage patterns work best for your specific use cases.
