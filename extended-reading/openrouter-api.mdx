OpenRouter is a revolutionary platform that provides unified access to hundreds of AI models through a single API. Instead of managing multiple API keys and accounts for different AI providers, OpenRouter gives you one interface to access models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and many more.

## What is OpenRouter?

OpenRouter functions as an intermediary service that normalizes access to various AI models through a consistent API schema similar to OpenAI's Chat API. This allows developers to switch between different LLM providers without changing their code implementation.

OpenRouter serves as a unified API platform that connects users to a diverse array of models from providers such as:

- Anthropic  
- OpenAI  
- Google  
- Meta  
- Mistral AI  
- Others
