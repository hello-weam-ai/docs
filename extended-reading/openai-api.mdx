title: "How to Generate an OpenAI API Key - 2025 Guide"
---

Getting started with OpenAI's powerful AI models like **GPT-4** requires an API key. Here's the updated step-by-step process for generating your OpenAI API key in 2025.


## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Navigate to OpenAI Platform

Go to [https://platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) in your web browser.

### Step 2: Sign Up or Log In

- If you don't have an account, click **"Sign up"** to create one.
- If you already have an account, click **"Log in"**.
- You can also use Google or Microsoft accounts for sign-up.

> If you're creating a new account, complete the email or phone verification process.

### Step 3: Access Your Dashboard

Once logged in, you'll be taken to the **OpenAI Platform dashboard**.

### Step 4: Create a Project

Click the **"Start building"** button on the top-right corner to create a new project.

### Step 5: Name Your API Key

You'll be prompted to name your API key. Use something descriptive like:

- `My App Integration`
- `Testing Project`

Then click **"Create secret key"**.

### Step 6: Copy and Secure Your Key

Once your key is generated:

- **Copy it immediately** – you won’t be able to see it again!
- **Store it securely** in a password manager or secure environment.

#### Security Notes:
- This is the **only time** you’ll see the full key.
- Never share it publicly or commit it to version control.
- If exposed, **revoke the key and generate a new one**.

### Step 7: Set Up Billing (If Required)

- OpenAI provides **$5 in free credits**.
- For continued usage, add your billing method by navigating to the **Billing** section in your dashboard.

### Step 8: Test Your API Key

You can test the key using:

- OpenAI’s [API documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs)
- A simple API call to verify it's working


## Difference Between API and Admin API Keys

Understanding the different types of API keys and their permission levels is crucial for secure and efficient implementation.

### API Key Types Comparison

| Feature              | **Normal API Keys (Project Keys)**           | **Admin API Keys**                                |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Purpose**  | Access OpenAI's AI models (e.g., GPT, DALL·E) | Manage OpenAI organization/account administratively |
| **Main Use Cases**   | Generate content, build apps, interact with models | Manage users, billing, org settings, access audit logs |
| **Scope**            | Project-specific                             | Organization-wide                                |
| **Who Can Create**   | Project members with permissions             | Organization owners only                         |
| **Access Level**     | AI model endpoints                           | Admin endpoints and org-wide actions             |
| **Security Risk**    | Medium                                       | High                                             |
| **Typical Users**    | Developers, Data Scientists, Engineers       | System Admins, Org Owners                        |


## Permission Levels Breakdown

| Permission Level       | Access Rights                                                                                              | Best For                                                | Security Level | Capabilities                    |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| All Permissions        | Full API access; Complete model access; All endpoints; Read, write, delete capabilities                    | Production apps; Full-feature development; Trusted use   | High Risk      | Everything the key allows        |
| Restricted Permissions | Endpoint control; Custom model selection; Per-feature read/write/none; Tailored access configuration       | Third-party tools; Scoped apps; Testing; Limited use     | Medium Risk    | Only specified operations        |
| Read Only              | View-only; No write or delete; Monitoring only                                                             | Analytics; Audit; Dashboards; External reporting tools   | Low Risk       | Information retrieval only       |

##  Use Case Scenarios

| Scenario                      | Recommended Key Type | Suggested Permission Level | Reasoning                             |
|------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Building a Chatbot App        | Normal API Key      | All or Restricted          | Requires full model interaction      |
| Managing Organization Users   | Admin API Key       | All                        | Needs org-wide management rights     |
| Third-Party Analytics Tool    | Normal API Key      | Read Only                  | Only pulls usage data                |
| Development Environment       | Normal API Key      | Restricted                 | Limits scope during testing          |
| Production AI App             | Normal API Key      | All                        | Needs full model access              |
| Billing Management System     | Admin API Key       | Restricted                 | Access to billing only               |
| Audit and Compliance Tool     | Admin API Key       | Read Only                  | Requires read-only access to logs and usage data |


##  Conclusion

Understanding the distinction between **Normal** and **Admin** API keys — and applying appropriate permission levels — is key to:

- Maintaining **security**
- Enabling proper **functionality**
- Avoiding **unintended access or exposure**

>  **Always follow the Principle of Least Privilege**  
> Only grant the minimum permissions required for each task or user.

This helps protect your organization while giving your apps the access they need.
