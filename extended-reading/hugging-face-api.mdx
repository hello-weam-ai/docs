HuggingFace provides access to thousands of AI models through their API, making it easy to integrate state-of-the-art machine learning capabilities into your applications. Here's how to create your HuggingFace API key.


## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Navigate to HuggingFace

Go to [https://huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co) in your web browser.

### Step 2: Sign In or Create an Account

Log into your existing account or create one using the **Login** or **Sign Up** option in the top right corner.

### Step 3: Access Your Profile

Click on your **profile icon** in the top right corner of the page.

### Step 4: Navigate to Access Tokens

In the dropdown menu, click **Access Tokens**, found just below **Settings**.

### Step 5: Create New Token

You’ll see a prompt to create a new token. Click **Create new token**.

### Step 6: Select Token Type

Choose from the following options:

#### Read Token
- Read-only access to public repositories  
- Cannot modify or write to content  
- Best for basic read access

#### Write Token
- Read and write access  
- Allows content editing and repository updates  
- Suitable for developers updating models

#### Fine-grained Token
- Custom permissions  
- Control access to:
  - Repositories
  - Inference
  - Webhooks
  - Billing
  - Discussions  
- Supports organization-level permissions

> Important: Token type cannot be changed after creation.

### Step 7: Configure Token Settings

#### For Read/Write Tokens:
- Enter a token name (e.g., `MyApp-API-Key`)  
- Click **Create token**

#### For Fine-grained Tokens:
- Name the token (e.g., `test`)
- Set permissions for:
  - Repositories  
  - Inference  
  - Webhooks  
  - Collections  
  - Billing  
  - Discussions and more  
- Define organization-level access if needed

### Step 8: Create Your Token

Click **Create token** after configuring the options.

### Step 9: Copy and Save Your Token

Your token will be displayed once.  
> Security Note: Copy and store it securely now — you will not be able to view it again later.


## Post-Creation: Access Token Dashboard

Once created, all your access tokens are listed and organized for easy management.
