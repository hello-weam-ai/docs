### Why Enable 2FA
Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your account by requiring a code from an app on your phone during sign-in, in addition to your password.

### Setting Up 2FA

#### Step 1: Download an Authentication App
First, download a two-factor authentication app on your phone or tablet, such as:
- **Authy** (recommended)
- **Authenticator** (Microsoft, Google, etc.)
- Any TOTP-compatible authentication app

#### Step 2: Scan the QR Code
1. Open your authentication app
2. Scan the QR code displayed in the Weam interface
3. The app will generate a unique account entry for Weam

#### Step 3: Enter Verification Code
1. Enter the 6-digit code from your authentication app
2. Click "Set Up Two-Factor Now" to complete the setup
