## Private Brain Control

### Enable/Disable Private Brain Access
As a manager or admin on Weam AI, you have control over how your team members interact with the platform through the Private Brain Access feature.

Located in the settings panel, this feature enables you to disable or enable private brain access for specific team members. When disabled, users are directed to collaborate only in shared brains, ensuring all AI interactions contribute to team level knowledge.

**This functionality is particularly useful when you want to:**
- Encourage collaborative work in shared spaces
- Maintain oversight of AI usage
- Ensure company resources are focused on team level objectives only

| Doc |    | ✅  |
| Prompt |    | ✅  |
| Agents  |    | ✅  |
| Brain | ✅  |    |

## Teams Management (Admins Only)

### Creating Teams
The Teams feature in Weam AI simplifies member organisation. This functionality allows admins to create groups, typically aligned with departments or project teams within Weam AI.

**Creating Teams:** 
Located next to the **Invite tab** in the Members section, the Teams feature enables admins to:
- Create department-specific teams (Sales, Marketing, Customer Success, etc.)
- Add multiple team members to groups with a single action

Understanding these permission boundaries helps ensure appropriate access control while maintaining team productivity and security.
