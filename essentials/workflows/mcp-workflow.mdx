## Overview

This workflow describes the general process for configuring and connecting third-party services through the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** integration system.  
MCP will store service data per user.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Environment Setup

- Configure environment variables for the target service:
  - `Client ID`
  - `Client Secret`
- Set up service configuration object with:
  - OAuth endpoints
  - Required scopes

### 2. OAuth Flow Implementation

- **Initiation**
  - User clicks **"Connect"**
  - Generate OAuth `state`
  - Redirect to service's OAuth URL

- **Callback**
  - Service redirects back with an `authorization code`
  - Frontend exchanges the code for an access token

- **Validation**
  - Verify the OAuth `state`
  - Handle and display errors as needed

- **Storage**
  - Encrypt and store access token with user information in the database

### 3. Database Update

- **Database Store**
  - Store the MCP service token in the user's collection like:

    ```json
    mcpdata: {
      SLACK: {},
      GITHUB: {}
    }
    ```

- **Disconnect Handler**
  - When disconnecting, remove the specific service token object from the user's database entry

### 4. State Management

- Use **Redux** to manage:
  - Connection status
  - Loading states
  - MCP data

- Store:
  - Encrypted tokens securely
  - User service selections

- Track:
  - Selected MCP services
  - Tool configurations for each

### 5. Tool Integration Points

- Define tools/actions available per service (e.g., Slack, GitHub)
- Configure service selection options in the UI
- Map service codes to respective tool functionality

### 6. Chat Interface

- Load userâ€™s connected MCP services when the chat page loads
- Display available MCP tools grouped by service
- User selects a tool from the list
- Collect required parameters using dynamic UI forms
- User submits a query, and the system processes the tool invocation
- Show results or tool responses inline within the chat interface

### 7. Disconnect MCP

- **User Initiation**
  - User clicks **"Disconnect"** in the service configuration modal
  - A confirmation dialog is shown to avoid accidental disconnections
  - User confirms the disconnection

- **Frontend State Update**
  - Show "Disconnecting..." loading state
  - Disable disconnect button during the process
  - Display visual feedback (spinner, progress bar, etc.)

- **Backend API Call**
  - Send a POST request to the backend with:
    - User authentication
    - Target service information
  - Handle response or error from the API
