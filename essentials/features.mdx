## Workspaces (Admins Only)

Workspaces are collaboration spaces that help large teams organize their work effectively. Think of them as distinct spaces where different teams/ verticals/ projects can operate independently while maintaining connected workflows. Your company workspace is automatically created upon first login, named after your organisation.

### Manage Workspaces (Admins Only)

- While team members can share resources and knowledge within their workspace, **only Admins can create and manage team member access and permissions.**
- To create a new workspace, Admins can click on the down arrow on the top left corner of the dashboard, beside the organisation’s name. Click on the **‘Add a Workspace’** button and add members/ teams who belong to the new workspace.
- To manage any workspace, Admins can access it by clicking on the **‘Settings’** button.  
  Go to the **‘Data Control’** section inside the ‘Settings’ and click on the **‘Archive Workspace’** tab. Here, you can manage various functionalities to manage the access and usage of a particular workspace.

## Brains:

By segregating information into dedicated Brains, organisations can maintain clear boundaries between different projects, teams, or initiatives while maintaining smooth collaboration and resource sharing.

### Shared Brains:

- Shared Brains are collaborative knowledge centres where team members can collectively access and interact with AI models. Team members who are part of any particular Shared Brain can view and use every element within it – from chat conversations and uploaded documents to saved prompts and custom AI agents.
- This visibility ensures that knowledge flows freely across your organisation, enabling teams to learn from each other's experiences.
- Shared Brains are particularly valuable for team projects and cross-departmental initiatives, as they create a single source for all project-related AI interactions.
- Every user automatically receives a Shared Brain named 'General Brain' upon signing up.
    
    Think of Brains as organised spaces within your workspace that store and manage all your AI interactions and resources.

### Private Brains:

- Private Brains provide individual team members with their own personal AI workspace within Weam. Every user automatically receives a Private Brain named 'Default' upon signing up, creating a space for individual work and experimentation.
- Private Brains are particularly useful for preliminary work – users can test new ideas, refine prompts, and perfect their AI interactions before sharing them with the broader team.
- Users maintain complete control over their Private Brain. However, Admins can limit the usage of Private Brains for team members if needed.

### Chats:

Chats in Weam are spaces for AI-powered discussions within each Brain. Team members can create chat threads for specific topics or projects, making it easy to organise and track different conversations.

Users can switch between different AI models mid-conversation and share chats via URLs.

### Import Chat Feature:

- Weam makes transitioning from other AI platforms seamless with our **‘Chat Import Feature’.** Whether you are moving from OpenAI (ChatGPT) or Anthropic, you can bring your valuable conversation history directly into Weam.

**The process is simple:** 

- First, export your chat history from your current platform (OpenAI/ Anthropic), which will give you a ZIP file containing ‘conversations.json’. Then, simply click the ‘Import Chats’ button on Weam's chat list page and upload this file. Your previous conversations will automatically appear in your selected Brain, organised and ready for reference.
- It's our way of ensuring your transition to Weam is smooth and that you can continue your AI journey without missing a beat.

- Generate a public URL with one click and share conversations with team members or clients
- Messages added after creating the link won't appear in the shared version
- The shared chat is view-only for recipients

---

## Prompt Feature:

Prompts in Weam are **reusable conversation starters** that help users interact more efficiently with AI models. By saving frequently used prompts, users can quickly access their standard queries, eliminating the need to retype common requests.

## Saving query “as a Prompt”:

- You can directly save frequently asked queries as Prompts by clicking on the ‘save as Prompt’ functionality. Weam's prompt templates go beyond basic text inputs by providing a detailed structure. These templates are designed to capture information about your brand, company, or product, making every AI interaction more relevant.
- Team members can access Prompts across the platform. That means all the team members can use Prompts created by other members even if they are not part of that particular brain.

### Sub fields under the Prompt template:

- **Brand Profile fields:** The Brand Profile template captures essential brand elements including name, slogan, mission, values, and target audience information. By incorporating these key brand identifiers, AI responses automatically align with your **brand's tone and messaging, making content creation more consistent.**
- **Company Info fields:** With fields for company name, mission, values, overview, vision, and location details, this template ensures AI understands your company's complete context. These details help generate responses that accurately reflect your **company's positioning and corporate identity in every interaction.**
- **Product Info fields:** This template includes crucial product details like name, category, description, USPs, specifications, and benefits. Having these product-specific fields helps AI generate precise, feature-focused content, making it useful for **product-related communications and marketing materials.**

- **How to run a prompt**
    
    **After saving all the important information in the Prompt template, to run the prompt,**
    
    - Go to the chat in which you want to use the newly created prompt
    - Click on the thunderbolt (⚡️) icon present in the chat box
    - Search the name of your prompt
    - Click on ‘Use this Prompt’ button
    - You can see the active prompt in your chat box

### Prompt + document

Enhance your prompts by uploading relevant documents directly from your computer. Whether it's reference materials, guidelines, or specific data, adding documents to your prompts ensures AI has comprehensive information to work with, resulting in more tailored outputs.

---

### Power Prompt:

Power Prompt is Weam's intelligent prompt enhancement tool that transforms basic instructions into detailed queries. **Power Prompt effectively bridges the gap between what you want to ask and what the AI needs to know** to provide the most accurate response, making your AI interactions more productive.

**How it works:**

- Simply enter your basic prompt, and with one click, Power Prompt automatically enriches it with relevant context, specifications, and parameters. The tool understands the intent behind your request and adds crucial elements that might have been missed.
