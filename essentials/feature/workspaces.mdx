## Workspaces (Admins Only)

Workspaces are collaboration spaces that help large teams organize their work effectively. Think of them as distinct spaces where different teams/ verticals/ projects can operate independently while maintaining connected workflows. Your company workspace is automatically created upon first login, named after your organisation.

### Manage Workspaces (Admins Only)

- While team members can share resources and knowledge within their workspace, **only Admins can create and manage team member access and permissions.**
- To create a new workspace, Admins can click on the down arrow on the top left corner of the dashboard, beside the organisation’s name. Click on the **‘Add a Workspace’** button and add members/ teams who belong to the new workspace.
- To manage any workspace, Admins can access it by clicking on the **‘Settings’** button.  
  Go to the **‘Data Control’** section inside the ‘Settings’ and click on the **‘Archive Workspace’** tab. Here, you can manage various functionalities to manage the access and usage of a particular workspace.
