# Weam Brings You ‘Connections’

When using your documents as knowledge base for AI it can answer questions specific to your data (policies, manuals, articles, etc.). The results are different, they are more accurate. However a document is a static data source, the values are defined. Interaction between those types of data source and large language models is good, easy, and efficient.

We moved a step further and established ‘Connections’ between dynamic data sources and your AI systems. Yes you guessed it right, using MCP (Model Context Protocol) in Weam you can.

MCP are standardized ways for AI systems to connect with external data sources and tools in a secure, controlled manner.

## What MCP Does?

MCP acts as a bridge between AI models and various external resources, allowing the AI to:

- Access real-time data from databases, APIs, and web services  
- Interact with local files and applications on your computer  
- Use specialized tools and services during conversations  
- Maintain consistent interfaces across different data sources
