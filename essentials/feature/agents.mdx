Agents in Weam are specialised AI assistants that can be customised for specific tasks and roles. These agents are designed to handle particular types of interactions based on their configured knowledge base.

- **Benefits of Using Agents:**
    - Get customised responses for specific departments or tasks
    - Choose specific LLM models that best suit your agent's purpose (e.g., GPT-4 for complex analysis, Claude for creative tasks)
    - Streamline departmental workflows with dedicated AI assistants
    - Perfect for teams needing focused AI support for particular functions

### **How Agents Work:**

- Users can easily switch between regular chat mode and agent-specific conversations. When chatting with an agent, responses are tailored to that agent's specific expertise and training. Simply select your desired agent from the list, and it will provide specialised responses until you exit the agent chat mode.
- Team members can access Agents across the platform. That means all the team members can use Agents created by other members even if they are not part of that particular brain.
