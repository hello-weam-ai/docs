## Settings (Admins Only):

### General:

In the general section, you can see two tabs:

**Models:**

- Here, you can see the current available models on Weam.

**Shared Links:**

- You can access all the links which have been shared by you and your team members on Weam from this tab.


### Data Control:

The Data Control section helps you manage your archived spaces and track storage space in Weam.

**View Archived Spaces:**
Access all your archived brains and workspaces in one place. Easily find and restore old content when needed.

**Check Storage Usage:**
The Storage tab shows you:

- How much space you are currently using
- What is taking up space

**Get more Storage:**
You can request additional storage right from this section. Just click the request button, and we will help you expand your storage capacity.

### Members:

### **User invite:**

**How to invite users (Admins Only):**

- The Invitation feature in Weam provides an easy process for admins and managers to bring new team members onto the platform. This system ensures organised team expansion while maintaining control.

**How it works:** 

- Admins/ managers can send invitations to new team members through the **â€˜membersâ€™** section from the settings. Each invitation generates a secure magic link that's automatically emailed to the invitee. When recipients click this link, they're guided through a simple two-step process:
1. Setting up their password
2. Accessing their new Weam account

### How to create Teams on Weam (Admins Only):

- The Teams feature in Weam simplifies member organisation. This functionality allows admins to create groups, typically aligned with departments or project teams within Weam.

**Creating Teams:** 

Located next to the **Invite tab** in the Members section, the Teams feature enables admins to:

- Create department-specific teams (Sales, Marketing, Customer Success, etc.)
- Add multiple team members to groups with a single action

- **Benefits of creating Teams**
    - When creating new shared brains, instead of adding members individually, you can simply select relevant teams.
    - Automatically adds all team members to the brain in bulk
    - Saves time in permission management
    - Simplifies the process of scaling brain access

### Enable/ Disable Private Brain:

As a manager or admin on Weam, you have control over how your team members interact with the platform through the Private Brain Access feature.

Located in the settings panel, this feature enables you to disable or enable private brain access for specific team members. When disabled, users are directed to collaborate only in shared brains, ensuring all AI interactions contribute to team level knowledge.

**This functionality is particularly useful when you want to:**

- Encourage collaborative work in shared spaces
- Maintain oversight of AI usage
- Ensure company resources are focused on team level objectives only
