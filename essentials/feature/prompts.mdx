Prompts in Weam are **reusable conversation starters** that help users interact more efficiently with AI models. By saving frequently used prompts, users can quickly access their standard queries, eliminating the need to retype common requests.

## Saving query “as a Prompt”:

- You can directly save frequently asked queries as Prompts by clicking on the ‘save as Prompt’ functionality. Weam's prompt templates go beyond basic text inputs by providing a detailed structure. These templates are designed to capture information about your brand, company, or product, making every AI interaction more relevant.
- Team members can access Prompts across the platform. That means all the team members can use Prompts created by other members even if they are not part of that particular brain.

### Sub fields under the Prompt template:

- **Brand Profile fields:** The Brand Profile template captures essential brand elements including name, slogan, mission, values, and target audience information. By incorporating these key brand identifiers, AI responses automatically align with your **brand's tone and messaging, making content creation more consistent.**
- **Company Info fields:** With fields for company name, mission, values, overview, vision, and location details, this template ensures AI understands your company's complete context. These details help generate responses that accurately reflect your **company's positioning and corporate identity in every interaction.**

Having these product-specific fields helps AI generate precise, feature-focused content, making it useful for **product-related communications and marketing materials.**
