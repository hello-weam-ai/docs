Chats in Weam are spaces for AI-powered discussions within each Brain. Team members can create chat threads for specific topics or projects, making it easy to organise and track different conversations.

Users can switch between different AI models mid-conversation and share chats via URLs.

### Import Chat Feature:

- Weam makes transitioning from other AI platforms seamless with our **‘Chat Import Feature’.** Whether you are moving from OpenAI (ChatGPT) or Anthropic, you can bring your valuable conversation history directly into Weam.

**The process is simple:** 

- First, export your chat history from your current platform (OpenAI/ Anthropic), which will give you a ZIP file containing ‘conversations.json’. Then, simply click the ‘Import Chats’ button on Weam's chat list page and upload this file. Your previous conversations will automatically appear in your selected Brain, organised and ready for reference.
- It's our way of ensuring your transition to Weam is smooth and that you can continue your AI journey without missing a beat.

- Click on the **"Star"** icon at the top right of the chat window.
