By segregating information into dedicated Brains, organisations can maintain clear boundaries between different projects, teams, or initiatives while maintaining smooth collaboration and resource sharing.

### Shared Brains:

- Shared Brains are collaborative knowledge centres where team members can collectively access and interact with AI models. Team members who are part of any particular Shared Brain can view and use every element within it – from chat conversations and uploaded documents to saved prompts and custom AI agents.
- This visibility ensures that knowledge flows freely across your organisation, enabling teams to learn from each other's experiences.
- Shared Brains are particularly valuable for team projects and cross-departmental initiatives, as they create a single source for all project-related AI interactions.
- Every user automatically receives a Shared Brain named 'General Brain' upon signing up.
    
    Think of Brains as organised spaces within your workspace that store and manage all your AI interactions and resources.

### Private Brains:

- Private Brains provide individual team members with their own personal AI workspace within Weam. Every user automatically receives a Private Brain named 'Default' upon signing up, creating a space for individual work and experimentation.
- Private Brains are particularly useful for preliminary work – users can test new ideas, refine prompts, and perfect their AI interactions before sharing them with the broader team.
- Users maintain complete control over their Private Brain. However, Admins can limit the usage of Private Brains for team members if needed.
