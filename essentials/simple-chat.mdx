description: "Understand the flow and architecture behind the Simple Chat powered by Python API and tool-enabled LLMs."
---

<Info>
  **Simple Chat is a multi-tool, model-based conversational framework**:
  - Supports dynamic tool invocation (e.g., image generation, web search)
  - Based on model selection, chat history, and LLM-driven tool dispatch
</Info>

Use this reference to understand the backend pipeline, tool activation logic, and data flow for generating intelligent responses.

<Steps>

<Step title="User Query Flow">

1. User sends a query from the frontend UI.
2. Python API receives the request and passes it to the **Service Controller**.
3. Controller selects an appropriate model service based on the **dropdown selection**.
4. Initializes the selected LLM along with the default tool-selection logic.
5. Simultaneously, **Chat Repository** is initialized using the provided chat ID.

</Step>

<Step title="Preparing the Prompt">

- The chat history retrieved from the repository is combined with the new user query.
- This combined prompt is passed to the LLM, ready for processing.
- The LLM is bundled with tools:
  - 🗣️ Simple Chat Tool
  - 🖼️ Image Generation Tool
  - 🌐 Web Analysis Tool
  - 🔍 Web Search Tool

</Step>

<Step title="Tool Invocation Logic">

<Info>
  **Tool Activation Conditions**
</Info>

- 🔍 Web Search Tool → Active **only** with `GPT-4.1-search`  
- 🖼️ Image Generation Tool → Enabled **only** for **GET models**  
- Simple Chat Tool and Web Analysis Tool are always available.

The LLM evaluates the query and context to select the most suitable tool to fulfill the request.

</Step>

<Step title="Streaming the Response">

1. The selected tool is executed (e.g., web search, image generation).
2. Tool invokes the LLM if necessary.
3. The final response is streamed **back to the frontend in real-time**.

</Step>

<Step title="Logging and Storage">

- Each LLM call is tracked:
  - **Cost** is computed based on input/output tokens using the **Cost Callback**.
  - **Responses** are logged in MongoDB using the **MongoDB Handler**.

</Step>

</Steps>

<Note>
  Tool eligibility is model-sensitive. Always verify the model selection logic before enabling new tools in production. For deeper integration logic, consult the Service Controller or Tool Wrapper implementations.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Tool does not trigger">

- Check model compatibility (e.g., image generation requires a GET model).
- Ensure LLM has access to the full tool registry.
- Validate tool dispatch logic in the Service Controller.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Response not streaming or delayed">

- Confirm WebSocket or server-sent events are functioning on the frontend.
- Check LLM latency or rate limiting issues.
- Review logs in MongoDB and Cost Callback for performance bottlenecks.
